Both Position Relative and Position Absolute are CSS positioning properties. They dictate the behavior of an element's position on the page. However, there are significant differences between the two.

Position Relative:

An element with Position Relative is positioned relative to its normal position in the document layout.
The element will still take up its normal space in the layout.
Other elements will not be affected by its new position.
The positioning properties used are top, right, bottom, and left. These properties specify how far an element should be moved from its normal position.
Example of Position Relative:

.box {
 position: relative;
 top: 20px;
 left: 30px;
}
Position Absolute:

An element with Position Absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport).
If an absolutely positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it will use the document body, and it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block.
The element is removed from the normal document flow; other elements will not be affected by its new position.
The positioning properties used are top, right, bottom, and left. These properties specify the element's new position.
Example of Position Absolute:

.box {
 position: absolute;
 top: 20px;
 left: 30px;
}
